# store ui development
- refactor and understand the store model
- fix store bugs (can't link card, can't upgrade/downgrade plans?)

# xiome entanglement
- further break off dependencies on outside systems (access model?)
- disentangle store api auth policies from whole xiome database/systems
- ugh, popups
