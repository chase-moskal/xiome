# xiome.io privacy policy

we try to minimize the amount of data we gather about users, and stick to the minimum that is necessary to provide the functionality for the components and features

we do our best to guard data with the best security practices we know

we'll never sell any data about our users

we record some statistics, and we might publish some, like the total number of people using the xiome platform as a whole

things we track:
1. **email address**  
  this is so we can send login links when the user wants to login. we don't publicize it. in an emergency, we may use the email addresses to contact people about something very important
1. **profile data**  
  info the user saves about their avatar, like nickname, tagline, profile picture preferences
1. **account stats**  
  like the timestamp for when each user first logged in, and most recently logged in
1. **community data**  
  info about communities the user has registered, including website homepage url, domain names, email addresses of appointed community administrators, stripe information so we can send funds to the community owners when they earn money
1. **permissions data**  
  info about what system roles and system privileges users might have in a community
1. **[stripe](https://stripe.com/) information for payments**  
  we store stripe information relating to user payments, which allows us to gather and direct the payments — we don't directly store any credit card numbers
1. **messages, comments, posts, likes, reports**  
  of course, we store the information users post, and what they mark as 'liked' and things like that

we're regularly adding new features, so it's possible this list is incomplete

xiome is open source software, so you can see for yourself what we're tracking — a good place to start looking would be our [database schema](s/assembly/backend/types/database.ts)

if you find anything we seem to be tracking that isn't on the list, please consider adding it to this list by submitting a github pull request for the addition

we may be forced to share the information we have with law enforcement agencies

if you have any questions, please email us at hello@xiome.io
